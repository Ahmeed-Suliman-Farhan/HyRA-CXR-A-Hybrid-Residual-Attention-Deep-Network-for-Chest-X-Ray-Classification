This repository contains the implementation of HyRA-CXR, a hybrid residual attention model developed for chest X-ray image classification. The project includes the main model notebook, an ablation study, and all generated visual and numerical outputs stored in the outputs and outputs2 directories. The implementation was developed in Python 3.9.7 using TensorFlow 2.17.1 and Keras 3.10.0, and provides a complete training, evaluation, and analysis pipeline for medical image classification research.
